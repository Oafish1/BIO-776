Main.R:
Main.R has the capability to run several datasets on Bisque, MuSiC, and SCDC.  Upon running, the program will utilize the provided data and pull testing data from the provided directory/file combination.  Four visualizations will be created, three of which pertain specifically to the accurate estimation of the algorithm.  These include
Error by Sample
Error by Provided Dataset
Error by Cell Type
Corrplot of the Data

There is a variable 'frac' which controls the amount of data to be retained during training.
